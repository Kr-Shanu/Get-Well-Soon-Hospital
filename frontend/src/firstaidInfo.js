        information: "Call 911 or your local emergency number if the wound is deep or you're not sure how serious it is. Don't move the injured person except if needed to avoid further injury.Before checking for the source of the wound, put on disposable gloves and other personal protective equipment if you have them.Remove any clothing or debris from the wound. Look for the source of the bleeding. There could be more than one injury. Remove any obvious debris but don't try to clean the wound. Don't remove large or deeply embedded objects, and don't probe the wound.Stop the bleeding. Cover the wound with sterile gauze or a clean cloth. Press on it firmly with the palm of your hand until bleeding stops. But don't press on an eye injury or embedded object. Don't press on a head wound if you suspect a skull fracture.Wrap the wound with a thick bandage or clean cloth and tape. Lift the wound above heart level if possible.Help the injured person lie down. If possible, place the person on a rug or blanket to prevent loss of body heat. Elevate the feet if you notice signs of shock, such as weakness, clammy skin or a rapid pulse. Calmly reassure the injured person.Add more bandages as needed. If the blood seeps through the bandage, add more gauze or cloth on top of the existing bandage. Then keep pressing firmly on the area.Tourniquets: A tourniquet is effective in controlling life-threatening bleeding from a limb. If needed, apply a commercially made tourniquet if it's available and you're trained in how to use it. Don't use an improvised tourniquet, such as a scarf or a belt.When emergency help arrives, tell them how long the tourniquet has been in place.Keep the person still. If you're waiting for emergency help to arrive, try to keep the injured person from moving.If you haven't called for emergency help, get the injured person to an emergency room as soon as possible.Wash your hands. After helping the injured person, wash your hands, even if it doesn't look like any blood got on your hands.",

        information:"Signs of severe choking:Sudden onset of distressUniversal sign of choking – holding both hands around front of the neck/throatUnable to cough effectivelyUnable to speak or breathePossible bluish-purple colour around the lips. There may also be evidence that the person was eating before the onset of symptoms or in the case of children, they may have been playing with small objects.Action – Choking adult or child over 1 year old:Immediately confirm if the victim is choking by asking them: ‘Are you choking?’Tell them you are going to help.Stand closely behind the victim and wrap your arms around their waist.Locate the victim’s bellybutton in front; this helps with correct positioning for your fist.Make a fist with your other hand, turn it and place it thumb-side against the victim’s belly directly above the bellybutton.Start delivering quick inward and upward thrusts into the belly in order to create an upward force to help remove the object.Continue to deliver thrusts as many times as is necessary while the victim remains conscious.This technique, known as the Heimlich Manoeuvre must only be performed on a conscious choking victim.Action – Choking infant under 1 year old:A choking infant may appear pale with bluish lips and cannot cry or breathe.Sit with the infant lying face-down along one of your arms using your thigh as a support, and ensure you support the infant’s head by placing your hand underneath the jaw.Keep the infant’s head low.Using the heel of your other hand, begin to deliver sharp back-slaps between the infant’s shoulder blades 5 times.If this is unsuccessful, turn the infant over onto his/her back along your opposite arm, supporting the head.Using 2 fingers, place them side by side in the centre of the infant’s chest and push downward 5 times.Continue to alternate between back-slaps and chest thrusts until you successfully remove the object and they can cry/breathe again.This technique should only be used on a conscious choking infant.If these techniques are successful, you should see the object eject forcefully from the victim’s mouth and they can begin to breathe/cough/speak again. It is advised to have the victim checked over by a healthcare provider.Remember, if any choking victim loses consciousness, becomes unresponsive and stops breathing normally, you must call 999 or 112 for an ambulance and begin to provide CPR until the ambulance arrives or the victim shows definite signs of life.",

        information:"Major burns need emergency medical attention. Once you’ve stopped the burning process, call 911 or get someone else to.For burns that are not an emergency, you can take these first aid steps:Flush the burned area with cool running water for several minutes. Do not use ice. Apply a light gauze bandage. If the burn is minor, you can put on an ointment, like aloe vera, before you cover it. Take Motrin (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen) for pain relief if you need it. Do not break any blisters that form",

        information:"Sit upright and don’t tilt your head back. Loosen any tight clothing around your neck. Pinch the lower end of the nose close to the nostrils and lean forward while you apply constant pressure for five to ten minutes. Don’t release and check the nose; it could prolong the bleeding. If the nosebleed is the result of trauma, you can reduce swelling by holding an ice pack against the bridge of the nose after the bleeding slows down. If it persists for more than ten minutes or returns later, call your doctor or go to the Emergency Room to check for breakage.",

        information:"Fractures are broken bones, and they can occur as a result of falls or other harsh impacts. When this happens, the affected part should be immobilized, and additional manipulation of the affected area should be avoided. Remember that a fracture could sever a blood vessel or a nerve if it is not immobilized, resulting in a much more severe injury. Immobilize the injured part, and transport the patient to the nearest hospital or medical clinic as soon as possible.Everyone needs a well-stocked first-aid kit at home and on the go.

        information:"Insect Bite/Sting: If the insect left a stinger, gently scrape the skin with your fingernail to remove it without breaking it. Refrain from using tweezers because that can squeeze more venom out of the stinger, causing further injury. Call 911 if you have trouble breathing, coughing, or develop a hoarse voice, hives, or swollen lips or tongue. To combat itching, apply 1% hydrocortisone cream or a topical antihistamine if the skin isn’t broken or scabbed. Contact your doctor if you suspect a tick bite. They may want to test for Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases.",
